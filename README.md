# WindTunnel

This is the github for the windtunnel.

the prerequistes to this working is using the lgpio library to acess the GPIO pins on the pi5. Additionally make sure you have the code from the git installed into some editor. (when I was working on it April 2025, I had it installed already as well as the libraries.

if you want to run the basic program on the PI5, you will need to run this line in the console:

'python3 example_hx711_multi.py'

If you want to run the graphing program run this line in the console:

'python3 graphing_wip.py'

if you run into any problems or have anyquestions, email me at ine@purdue.edu
